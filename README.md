This project implements a modular, real-time Battery Management System (BMS) firmware stack for STM32L4 MCUs, designed for embedded safety, diagnostics, and simulation. Built with FreeRTOS, Google Pigweed, and Bazel, it provides a modern and testable embedded software architecture with focus on middleware, state machines, and platform abstraction
